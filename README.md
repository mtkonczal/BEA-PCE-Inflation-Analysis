# BEA-PCE-Inflation-Analysis

Folder is a bit of a mess, currently overhauling this analysis.

Monthly analysis of PCE Inflation:

0_run_monthly_graphics.R : The master file that runs the others.

1a_helper_functions.R : Functions that help the analysis, including the BEA request calls.

1b_load_PCE_items.R : Where the data is created.
